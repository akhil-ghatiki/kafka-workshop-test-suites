# Setup Kafka (on Mac)

For the workshop, it is required that every participant has Kafka running locally for working on hands-on exercises. 
We will be using docker client on `colima` to set-up our Kafka server.

## Steps to set-up docker client and colima (when you do not have docker desktop installed)

### 1. Install colima

``
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install colima
``

### 2. Install docker client

``
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install docker
``

## Steps to set-up docker client and colima (when you have docker desktop installed)

### 1. Install colima
```
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install colima
```
## Steps to start colima

### 1. Start colima
First time: `colima start --cpu 4 --memory 4`
Next time onwards: `colima start`

### 2. Check the docker context, to make sure it is colima
`docker context show`

### Steps to install docker-compose

```
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install docker-compose
```

## Steps to set-up Kafka running locally with zookeeper  (using docker with colima)

### 1. Start kafka brokers and UI
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d`

### 2. Verify if the service is up and running
`docker ps`

### 3. Verify kafka broker logs
```
docker logs --follow kafka-workshop-1

docker logs --follow kafka-workshop-2

docker logs --follow kafka-workshop-3
```

### 4. Access UI using below
`http://localhost:8095/`

### 5. Stop kafka brokers and UI
Once you are done with workshop, stop Kafka server using below command.

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml down`

## Steps to stop colima (and switch back to docker desktop if you have it)

1. Stop colima using `colima stop`.
2. Check the docker context, to make sure it is default (for Docker desktop users)
`docker context show`
